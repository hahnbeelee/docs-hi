MANGOPAY's payments solution relies on electronic wallets. These wallets hold the funds processed by MANGOPAY on behalf of platforms and their users.

MANGOPAY is the only partner a platform needs to handle all payments from beginning to end. We specialize in third-party payments, which means that platforms using our services are intermediaries between two groups. For example, they could be buyers and sellers on a marketplace, or project owners and contributors on a crowdfunding platform.

## Value Chain

Your end users are using your platform to make payments. MANGOPAY handles these payments via our API, which is integrated into your app or website. Our API acts as a payment gateway and we deal with everything needed to make payments happen: card issuers and networks, banks, payment methods, technical protocols, and so on.

In a typical integration, MANGOPAY takes the role of a payment processor and acquirer (so called due to the acquisition of the funds from the end user). As a licensed Electronic Money Institution (EMI), MANGOPAY places the acquired funds on an e-wallet for the paying user.
