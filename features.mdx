hello again
Mangopay's payments solution relies on electronic wallets. These wallets hold
the funds processed by Mangopay on behalf of platforms and their users.

Mangopay is the only partner a platform needs to handle all payments from
beginning to end. We specialize in third-party payments, which means that
platforms using our services are intermediaries between two groups. For example,
they could be buyers and sellers on a marketplace, or project owners and
contributors on a crowdfunding platform.

## Value chain

Your end users are using your platform to make payments. Mangopay handles these
payments via our API, which is integrated into your app or website. Our API acts
as a payment gateway and we deal with everything needed to make payments happen:
card issuers and networks, banks, payment methods, technical protocols, and so
on.

In a typical integration, Mangopay takes the role of a payment processor and
acquirer (so called due to the acquisition of the funds from the end user). As a
licensed , Mangopay places the acquired funds on an e-wallet for the
paying user.
