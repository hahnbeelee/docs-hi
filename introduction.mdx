    end
    subgraph subgraph2
        direction TB
        top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom]
    end
    %% ^ These subgraphs are identical, except for the links to them:

    %% Link *to* subgraph1: subgraph1 direction is maintained
    outside --> subgraph1
    %% Link *within* subgraph2:
    %% subgraph2 inherits the direction of the top-level graph (LR)
    outside ---> top2
