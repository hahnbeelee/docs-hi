This guide introduces Claude’s enterprise capabilities, the end-to-end flow for developing with Claude, and how to start building.

## What you can do with Claude

Claude is designed to empower enterprises at scale with [strong performance](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/de8ba9b01c9ab7cbabf5c33b80b7bbc618857627/Model_Card_Claude_3.pdf) across benchmark evaluations for reasoning, math, coding, and fluency in English and non-English languages.

Here’s a non-exhaustive list of Claude’s capabilities and common uses.

| Capability | Enables you to... |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Text and code generation | <ul><li>Adhere to brand voice for excellent customer-facing experiences such as copywriting and chatbots</li><li>Create production-level code and operate (in-line code generation, debugging, and conversational querying) within complex codebases</li><li>Build automatic translation features between languages</li><li>Conduct complex financial forecasts</li><li>Support legal use cases that require high-quality technical analysis, long context windows for processing detailed documents, and fast outputs</li></ul> |
| Vision | <ul><li>Process and analyze visual input, such as extracting insights from charts and graphs</li><li>Generate code from images with code snippets or templates based on diagrams</li><li>Describe an image for a user with low vision</li></ul> |
| Tool use | <ul><li>Interact with external client-side tools and functions, allowing Claude to reason, plan, and execute actions by generating structured outputs through API calls</li></ul> |
